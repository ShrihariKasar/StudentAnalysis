```

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of marks distribution
- Subject-wise performance comparison
- Detection of underperforming or outperforming students
- Correlation analysis of subject scores

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **NumPy**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The notebook reads a dataset containing student marks.
2. It processes and cleans the data.
3. It performs analysis and visualizations to uncover patterns:
   - Average marks
   - Subject-wise trends
   - Heatmaps for correlations
   - Boxplots and histograms for distribution
4. Generates insights for possible academic intervention.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-marks-analysis.git
   cd student-marks-analysis
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook StudentAnalysis.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Sample Output

Graphs and charts such as:
- Heatmaps showing correlations
- Line plots showing subject performance
- Histograms showing marks distribution
